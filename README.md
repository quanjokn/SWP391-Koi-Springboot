Welcome to our Koi Farm, where we pride ourselves on offering a wide variety of high-quality Koi fish, cultivated with care and dedication. Our farm specializes in providing both imported purebred Koi, F1 hybrids, and native Vietnamese Koi, ensuring that customers can find the perfect fish to match their preferences and needs.

We are committed to excellence not only in the breeding and care of our Koi but also in the services we offer. Whether you are a hobbyist looking to expand your collection or a business seeking Koi for commercial purposes, we provide detailed information on each Koi fish, including origin, gender, age, size, temperament, feeding requirements, and screening rates.

At our farm, we offer Koi fish for sale individually or in batches. For individual purchases, we provide certificates of origin, health status, and any awards the fish may have won, ensuring transparency and quality. Customers can also take advantage of our consignment services, allowing them to care for or sell their Koi through our farm, either offline (standard care) or online (business purposes).

Our platform allows you to easily compare Koi fish, manage your orders, take advantage of promotions, and track your purchase history. We are committed to providing a seamless experience, from browsing to checkout, and offering excellent after-sale services like Koi care and consignment.

With a focus on customer satisfaction, we also provide a robust system for feedback, ratings, and loyalty programs. Our dashboard and reporting tools help streamline your experience and keep you informed every step of the way.

Thank you for choosing our Koi Farm Shop. Let us help you find the perfect Koi to add beauty and harmony to your life!
